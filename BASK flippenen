# Summary 

**The DVM should support price requests for**

* List item
BASKUSD
USDBASK
MPHUSD  
USDMPH 
APWUSD  
USDAPW
SNOWUSD  
USDSNOW 
NDXUSD  
USDNDX

* List item
The canonical identifiers should be
`BASKUSD` , `USDBASK` ,  `MPHUSD` , `USDMPH` , `APWUSD` , `USDAPW` , `SNOWUSD` , `USDSNOW` , `NDXUSD` , `USDNDX`

# Motivation
Adding these  price identifiers allows the use of the base currencies as collateral for minting synthetics or call options. See also the [related collateral UMIP]
Any of the base currencies could used to mint yield dollars or other synthetics, and liquidators could identify under collateralized positions by comparing the USD value of the locked collateral.
Base currency call options could be minted and paid out based on the USD price of the base currency at expiry.
KPI options tied to the price of the base currency could be minted, with a payout increasing as the base currency price increases.

# Rationale

*Excepting MPH, APW, SNOW, and NDX as price identifiers, will help hasten the UMIP process for the afore mentioned protocols, if and when the decide to involve their communities in the programs that the UMA protocol has to offer. By supplying these price identifiers now, it will limit resources needed to create  PI UMIPs  and steps in the overall UMIP process for these protocols. This would cut down time from conception, to issuance of UMIPs, making a more user friendly product. Also resources could then be allocated to better assist these communities in creating their UMIPs for the UMA protocol. All data has come from reliable sources.

# Implementation

*Describe how UMA tokenholders should arrive at the price in the case of a DVM price request. Document each step a voter should take to query for and return a price at a specific timestamp.

**Step 1** 
**Step 2:** 
...
**Step** *n-1*:   Round to** *x* **decimals to get the** *BASK* **USD price**.
**Step** *n* :  **To get the USD** *BASK* **price, voters should take the inverse of the result of Step** *n-2* **(unrounded** *BASK* **USD price) then round to** *x* **decimal places.**

*This section should include an example calculation where you pick a specific timestamp and calculate the price at that timestamp.*

# Security Considerations

*All of these currencies while new to markets are popular and traded frequently on several established exchanges as well as some of the lesser known exchanges. While newer currencies can be questionable, after research was done these listed currencies it was determined they be beneficial to UMA protocol and the clients it serves. A summary of each of the listed currencies will be included with this UMIP.*
**BASK Security considerations**
*Security Considerations:*
Audited by Haechi
A final fee of 6 BASK needs to be added to the store contract.
Currently in Beta testing. $UMA holders should evaluate the on going cost and benefit of supporting this asset as a collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. UMA holders should take note of the collaterals nature as liquidity, if the collateral changes, or if added robustness(Eg. via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

**APWINE Security Considerations**
Audited by Bramah Systems.
A final fee of 178 needs to be added to the store contract.
*Security Considerations* :
$UMA holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as a collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. UMA holders should take note of this collateral nature as liquidity, if the collateral changes, or if added robustness(Eg. via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation

**MPH Security Considerations:**
*Security Considerations:*
Audited by Peck shield and Quantstamp. Additional features were Audited by Certik and Peckshield.
A final fee of 9 MPH needs to be added to the store contract

**SNOW Security Considerations:**
Audited by Quantstamp
A final fee of 39 SNOW needs to be added to the store contract.
*Security Considerations* :

**NDX Security Considerations:** *Security considerations:*
Relative to most fiat currencies, NDX is much more volatile and is very nascent (March 2021) in the Ethereum ecosystem. It also has poor liquidity at this time, being traded almost exclusively on Uniswap. Liquidation should improve as tokens are distributed, but at the time NDX is very concentrated to the NDX governance organization. Contract developers should exercise extreme caution when parameterizing EMP contracts using NDX as a collateral currency

Additionally, Indexed finance is still in beta and has not yet been audited by an established security firm, however they have been audited by two individuals with previous associations to security firms.
$UMA-holders should evaluate the ongoing cost and benefit of supporting this asset as collateral and also contemplate removing support of this collateral if liquidity concerns are identified. $UMA-holders should take note of the collateral’s nature as liquidity of the collateral changes, or if added robustness (eg via TWAPs) are necessary to prevent market manipulation
